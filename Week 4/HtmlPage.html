        <h2><a id="Programming">Programming Experience</a></h2>
        <p>
            My main focus throughout school has been web programming, but I have experience with many
            programming languages aside from web languages. I have written many webpages as well
            as a handful of programs and one SQL database from scratch. The languages I've worked with are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I am also currently learning Javascript, ASP.NET in C#, and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also worked with many programs when it comes to writing code and creating
            webpges. Some of the programs I am familiar with working in are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eclipse</li>
            <li>MySQL Workbench</li>
            <li>Visual Studio</li>
            <li>CoffeeCup</li>
            <li>Microsoft Studio</li>
            <li>Adobe Suite</li>
        </ul>

            OMNOVA website into Chinese.

        <h2><a id="Personal">Personal Life</a></h2>
        <p>
            I have a number of hobbies outside of coding. I own two dogs and enjoy spending most
            of my free time with them. I also enjoy doing logic-based puzzles such as nonograms
            and sudoku puzzles, as well as standard jigsaw puzzles. Some of my other hobbies include:
